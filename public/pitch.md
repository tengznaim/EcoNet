### Video Presentation

- In Malaysia, we noticed that recycling isn't a common habit mainly because people just aren't sure where they can send their recyclables and lack motivation for it. This becomes an issue as waste accumulates everywhere.
- Our solution, is to build an online platform that connects recycling centres with the public.

- Flow -> Login -> Dashboard (recycle) -> Map -> Put yourself on the map for centers to find you or, you can find centers yourself based on your location -> opt to directly message centers to enquire about their services such as whether they offer pickup and centers can also provide a price estimate based on the user's declared recyclables -> Account that shows your recycling progress to keep you motivated to recycle.

That's all from us. Thank you for giving this opportunity and I hope you find this idea impactful!

### Final Pitch

Good morning, evening and night to everyone (since we're all over the world). We are N&M works!

Now, 79 percent.
You know what that is?
It is the percentage of people who don't currently recycle, right here in my country, Malaysia.
That is a major 26 million people of our country's population.
Why is that so you may ask? Well, it comes to two main reasons as we see it: they want to recycle but they don't where they can go and two, they just lack motivation to do so.

So, to that we bring EcoNet, a platform that connects users to recycling centers.
We provide an easy method for you to fill in what you want to recycle and in what quantity.
In one simple click, you can put yourself up on the map to broadcast what you want to recycle to the recycling centers.
You also get to see your nearby recycling centers and directly interact with them.
And last but not least, your account shows you how much you've recycled to keep you on your toes and motivated to recycle more for the times to come.

Why is this the future for the planet? Because it doesn't stop here in our home country. We bel ieve this can go global, connecting users from all the world to their local recycling centers, motivating each and every one of us to recycle and maintain the best of our environment.
I'm pretty sure we've all seen the movie Wall-E right? Despite being fictional, sweet and cartoony, it's scary to think how real it could also possibly be. The world takes care of us, so it's only fair that we aim to repay the favour.

EcoNet, connecting users to the habit of recycling. A simple solution to a big problem. That's all from us, N&M.
